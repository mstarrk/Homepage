        <div class="rounded-3 bg-dots border-primary bg-color-secondary mt-5 p-5">
            <p class="lead">Hi! I'm <strong>Juan Jose Morales</strong> from Argentina! ‚úåÔ∏èüßâ</p>

            <p class="lead">Thank you for checking this website I made using <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap
                    5</b>.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="lead">This is my solution for <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/8/homepage/"
                    target="_blank">CS50's Problem Set 8, called Homepage</a>. The challenge was to
                build a
                static website that adheres to the specifications provided
                using
                the languages and
                tools mentioned above.</p>

            <p class="lead">I had the freedom to choose what the website should look like. I went with a showcase on
                CS50
                itself, strongly
                focusing on CSS to make a visually appealing and responsive design.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="lead">Although I've mentioned many things about the course, I think it does not do justice to how
                good
                it is.
                If you are interested in Computer Science or are a developer, I <strong class="pun">strongly</strong>
                encourage you
                to try the
                course.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p class="lead">I've been doing programming for the last few years. My curiosity about the subject began
                with gamedev and Unity, which led me to university to learn the fundamentals of object-oriented
                programming and C#.</p>

            <br>

            <p class="lead">
                The university has given me a diverse range of knowledge and experience, including:
            <ul>
                <li class="lead">Discrete mathematics and statistics</li>
                <li class="lead">Web development with PHP and SQL</li>
                <li class="lead">Fullstack desktop applications using Windows Forms and C#</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <br>
            <p class="lead">However, I still had one missing piece from the puzzle that CS50 helped me find:
                <strong>what's
                    going on
                    behind the
                    curtains?</strong>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="lead">I had these questions because of the abstraction that I was not familiar with coming from a
                high-level
                programming language like C#.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="lead">Questions like:</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="lead">What really is an array?</li>
                <li class="lead">What makes an int?</li>
                <li class="lead">Where are these things even defined?</li>
                <li class="lead">How does hardware come into play?</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="lead">And a million more that made me feel like an impostor.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="lead">Initially, I was very skeptical of the course because I already have some programming
                experience. </p>
            <p class="lead">I thought it was going to be boring. But I immediately fell in love with the way the course
                was taught and the unbelievable production work it had. </p>

            <p class="lead">I mistakenly thought it was going to be easy. And it was ... <em>for the first two problem
                    sets.</em> Then <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/3/tideman/"
                    target="_blank">Tideman</a> happened. Needless to say, it was challenging.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p class="lead">Now that I'm just about to finish the course., I can say most of those doubts I had are now
                out of
                my mind.</p>

            <br>
