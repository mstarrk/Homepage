                    <p class="card-text">Dive into the C programming language, a low-level language that will show you
                        how everything functions behind the curtains. Over the course of 5 lectures and a variety of
                        different sets
                        of problems and tasks, you will develop a solid programming foundation that will include
                        algorithms, data structures and memory management.

                        every purpose.

                        While working on very interesting problem sets, you will add Python to your toolkit to solve
                        many different problems.

                        You will learn how to work with data, file system and use Python to develop
                        applications, automate processes, and even build your own websites and APIs.

                        Product Managers are just a few of the many professions that rely on SQL for data retrieval.

                        In this course you'll learn how to use it to manage data easier and to use it in client-server
                        operations.
